	<h2>Site Intent</h2>
	<h3>Client Goals</h3>
	<p>Redesign site with a more direct e-Commerce focus to increase sales and provide a 
	rich shopping experience. Particular attention to the home page, including information 
	and products organization, and site navigation is foremost. E-Commerce design should 
	combine a look and usability that is at once unique and eye-catching. Website needs to 
	be as usable and as customer-friendly as possible. Additionally, responsive web design 
	needs to be incorporated for mobile devices. Lastly, W3C validation checks for both 
	HTML5 and CSS contain numerous errors that will be evaluated and corrected accordingly.</p>
	<p>Currently, LucyStore.com has a site that is pleasing to the eye, but lacks cohesiveness 
	and direction throughout the site. LucyStore.com offers a plethora of products and 
	information, but finding and navigating to the aforementioned can be time consuming 
	and confusing to the user. While LucyStore.com does offer detailed product information 
	and quality product images, it is lacking in clear design (it is a catchy website 
	design, but there is not a strong enough focus on the products); user-friendly 
	navigation/convenient menus; a simple and transparent checkout process 
	(users are directed to a different page that leaves behind any design of LucyStore.com); 
	adequate product filters and search options; and information regarding payment options.</p>
	<h3>Consumer Goals</h3>
	<p>Consumers want the shopping process to be pleasant, quick, and most importantly easy.
	LucyStore.com accomplishes some of this.  Call to action buttons, i.e. "Add to Cart", 
	are well placed and easily distinguishable on product's page. However, more attention 
	needs to be applied to organization and navigation, as well as the checkout page.</p>
	<h3>Specific Ideas for Redesign</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>Show the advantages of LucyStore.com products. A list of product categories or a grid 
		to showcase products. Special deals and new arrivals are also good to coax the average 
		visitor to buy.</li>
		<li>Deals, Freebies, and Promos. Grab user interest in a matter of seconds upon their entry 
		to the site; adding shopping deals attracts buyers fast. Discounts and special 
		deals are usually the first things that website visitors look for. Alluring promises 
		and unique prices stimulate visitors to stay on the site, spend money, and come back. 
		Position eye-catching banners with discount offers on the upper part of the home page.</li>
		<li>Latest news and most popular products. When there are news, a sales period or 
		upcoming events that buyers should know about the product, the home page is the best 
		place to house them. Do not make it too hard for users to find exclusive deals and 
		prices.</li>
		<li>Payment Systems Icons. Online stores commonly use credit and debit cards, gift 
		vouchers, PayPal, etc as their main payment system. Clarify payment options in advance. 
		Payment details should be displayed on the home page in plain sight and are most 
		easily found at the footer or on the top right corner.</li>
		<li>Shopping Cart, Login Box and Search Box. The shopping cart, login box and search 
		box features are usually placed together at the top-right of the page.</li>
		<li>Social Media Links. Social media websites, such as Facebook, Twitter, and Pinterest 
		bring excellent opportunities for self-promotion and also keep customers aware of the 
		latest news, or special deals which are oriented towards followers only. Online 
		communities can also help find new customers who are not familiar with the site yet.</li>

	<h2>Competitive Analysis</h2>
	<p>Competitive analysis to similar websites is still being compiled. Web analytics for
	LucyStore.com are "unquantified" on <a href="http://www.quantcast.com/">Quantcast.com</a> 
	and <a href="http://www.alexa.com/">Alexa.com</a> ranks LucyStore.com at 192,351 in the 
	U.S., but provides no other information. Similar sites to LucyStore.com include:</p>
	<ul>
		<li><a href="http://www.ilovelucysuperstore.com/">ILoveLucySuperStore.com</a>
		<li><a href="http://www.shop.lucy-desi.com/">Lucy-Desi.com</a>
		<li><a href="http://www.retroplanet.com/CTGY/I_Love_Lucy_Collectibles/">RetroPlanet.com</a>
	</ul>
	<p>Unfortunately, these sites also garnish few results. However, 
	<a href="http://www.cbsstore.com/i-love-lucy/index.php?v=cbs-ilovelucy/">CBS Shop</a> offers
	some I Love Lucy memorabilia. There is data for this site, but it is for CBS as a whole, 
	rendering figures incomparable.</p>

	<h2>Target Audience</h2>
	<p>Notwithstanding the current status of website analysis, it is most likely safe to 
	classify most of LucyStore.com's visitors as women in between the ages of 30-70. Assuming
	such, two customer personas follow, each from opposite sides of the age spectrum.
	<h3>Heather</h3>
	<p>Heather is 30 years old. She is a financial advisor at Goldman &amp; Sachs who often works
	sixty or more hours per week. She spends the majority of her time in her office, which she
	decorates with 50s TV memorabilia. Heather is a savvy internet user and looks for this 
	memorabilia on her short breaks.  As a collector, she is always looking for something new; 
	as a financial advisor, she is always looking for a great deal.</p>
	<h3>Rosemary</h3>
	<p>Rosemary is 67 years old. She is a retired museum curator who has fond memories of sitting 
	in the living room with her best friend in front of the old black and white television set.
	Rosemary has three granddaughters who she loves spending time with. When they visit, they
	usually spend their time baking cookies and watching old tv episodes on DVD. Recently, Rosemary
	purchased a laptop which the kids have been helping Rosemary to learn. She has become proficient
	in a short amount of time, but becomes easily frustrated when she can't find what she is searching
	for.</p>
