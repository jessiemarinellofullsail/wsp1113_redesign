	<h2>Site Intent</h2>
	<p>Redesign site with a more direct e-Commerce focus to increase sales and provide a 
	rich shopping experience. Particular attention to the home page, including information 
	and products organization, and site navigation is foremost. E-Commerce design should 
	combine a look and usability that is at once unique and eye-catching. Website needs to 
	be as usable and as customer-friendly as possible. Additionally, responsive web design 
	needs to be incorporated for mobile devices. Lastly, W3C validation checks for both 
	HTML5 and CSS contain numerous errors.</p>
	<p>Currently, LucyStore.com has a site that is pleasing to the eye, but lacks cohesiveness 
	and direction throughout the site. LucyStore.com offers a plethora of products and 
	information, but finding and navigating to the aforementioned can be time consuming 
	and confusing to the user. While LucyStore.com does offer detailed product information 
	and quality product images, it is lacking in clear design (it is a catchy website 
	design, but there is not a strong enough focus on the products); user-friendly 
	navigation/convenient menus; a simple and transparent checkout process 
	(users are directed to a different page that leaves behind any design of LucyStore.com); 
	adequate product filters and search options; and information regarding payment options.</p>
